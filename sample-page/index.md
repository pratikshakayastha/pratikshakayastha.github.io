  The day was black day of my whole life. She left alone me in this world. I feel now I am totally wasted. I have so many strange feelings in my mind when I came to know that she passed away.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Like Always I woke up at around 630 am to get ready for my office.  I had chat yesterday that she wished to go to Manakamana but she was not sure.  I called after I woke up to know that she went to temple or not. But she did not answer my call. Thinking she is on the way or might be not appropriate to receive my call, I left my room and headed towards Office. The day passed normal as always. After finishing office stuffs, I reached at my place at nearly 5.30 pm. It means clock in Nepal was nearly 9.15 pm.  This is the time we normally chat or call. I waited for 5-6 minutes in my Viber and I did not find any response. Then I logged into my Facebook account. Few minutes later I check her profile if she had made some changes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As soon I opened her profile, I felt from sky and smashed on the ground badly. I was broken in thousands of pieces. I was just gazing her profile picture. She had aashiqui2 profile picture in those days. So i was thinking she and I am in the same way. I   could not do any and words are not coming into my mind. For me world has ended. I see flood of comments on her wall saying RIP and memory and&#8230;.. I could not believe though I see every one&#8217;s comment.  She told me to come back Nepal and take her away. How can she leave me alone?? These types of question consumed the memory of my brain. Then I called her one of the friend from my cell. Then she said &#8220;YES&#8221;.  Suddenly I fell suffocate in breathing.  I was alone in my room. I want to live with her forever. Always, I used to add word &#8220;Forever&#8221; after I love You. I started cried loudly alone in that room. I am soft hearted .I took medicine for more than 5 years when I was teen. I am scared of dark always. I never watch horror movies and other deadly accidents stuffs live or in internet also.  So I am worried. It was very hard to breath for me which I cannot express with words. She was my first and last love. I cannot love other as much I used to love her. I felt my heart is pumping very very faster than normal.  I took a glass of water to breathe.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Few minutes later I made a call to one of her friend (Anita) with whom I also used to talk some time before also.  She started telling me what happened. I was unable to hear the full speech from her side and said her to stop telling me. I was crying heavily. Tears were flowing down and cannot handle myself. I was smashing my hands here and there. I don&#8217;t know what to do. I only know that I loved her a lot and I think she will come back soon to accomplish her promises.  I called and hanged up many times with her. I even cannot see her picture in my cell also.  Soon I disabled her Facebook. I had no potential to see those messages written on her wall. I thought to close her Facebook. Immediately I did mine also.  If I use my FB, I will stuck. I only used FB in those days was to communicate with her mostly. I have more than 200 thousands chat logs only in FB. We used to chat in whatsapp, Viber, Nimbuzz and Mig33 and even on Skype too. I scroll down to see our last communication in Viber. I cannot tolerate the words replied by her and soon close the app also. I called my sister and she was scare about me that I will do strange things because I was only in my room. I used to live with my friends. Because of my summer job I moved to new place alone. She was repeating that no to do anything that will harm myself just take care.  After some time I called my own brother and express my feelings. He was also very worried about me.  I was alone and just crying and stretching my hair by myself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
   I drank almost 2 liters of water in nearly one hour because of suffocation. At the time of writing this also, I feel uneasy in breathing. My heart pumps faster.  What I did is I cried whole night without eating anything just drinking water. I was praying for the god to send her for 1 minute and take away again. It is believed that good people are taken away quickly to their place (heaven). I registered this domain name in the memory of my love. It was almost 11 pm and I was still wondering why she did not come online. I need to talk at least few minutes before I go to sleep. How can I sleep now without good night message of her.  My eyes didn&#8217;t want to sleep today though everybody was sleeping well. I was thinking that world is useless for me onwards. I was just staring at the window, ceiling and wall. I see her every where whispering &#8220;I am always with you&#8221;. I wanted to see her pic but I had not so effort to see her. I thought I will not look into her pictures, messages and any memories.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It was almost 2 am and still waiting her good night message. Still I cannot stop crying. She taught me a lot how to live in this world. She used to tell always &#8220;Study Well Else My mom will not accept you&#8221;. She was the only with whom I used to share my each and every events of life. I was always excited to share things with her. But she never tries to open her heart at first but when I start then she start sharing her events and feelings. I had so many good things attached with her feelings. Thinking like these stuffs, it&#8217;s almost 4 am still my eyes and brain was thinking of her only. The job I am doing at that time was one of the great parts of my life. My brother was still on Viber with me though I am not talking with him. He was worried about me if something happen. I also gave numbers of new friends to my brother to contact them If something happen to me. Around 4.30 I fell asleep and woke up at 6 am.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
   I took shower thinking she will come back. Around 7 I left room and headed towards office. It was my second week and whole day I did nothing. I could not concentrate at work.  I was crying inside and I even do not want to talk. I was not able to tolerate the pain and went to bathroom to fall down my tears. I felt suffocation inside myself. Remembering her words, talk, and everything I end up my day without doing anything. I left work nearly 4. As soon I reached home, I freely cried once and talked with her friend. Like yesterday, I was like energy less, breathless. I do not know how will I survive onwards days. Anita was praising and scared of me. I was just feeling her beside. Only she left me are sweet memories.  In this way that day passed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Similarly week, months passed away and still assuming she will come and say &#8220;I am always with you dear&#8221;. Of course she is always with me. I promise myself that I will full fill her wishes and the things left undone.
