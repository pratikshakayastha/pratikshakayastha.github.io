  She was very happy for me about my job. She was busy on finding topic for research those days. We used to chat almost every day at the night time of Nepal.Â  We could not talk in viber before 3-4 days. She used to sleep alone mostly. But at those some days Sami (her younger sister) was back from hostel for holiday. She was scared to talk in front of her sister. So we only text each other for communicate. We used talk on normal things. From one week she was telling me &#8220;I am missing you a lot&#8221;. She wants me to come back soon. She used to cry in Skype which also made me cry. Two days ago we both cried on Viber telling &#8220;when will be that day we will be together forever&#8221;. But she was expressing in very different way than in normal day before one week. I could see tears falling down from her eyes when we had couple of talk in Skype. I did not know that she was crying to left me forever. She needs my hug before we close our conversation. It was me that I could not understand her crying, messages and every thing. I was unable to stop her going away. In last Conversation also, she said just study well and get one good job. Then she asked me to come back and take her for forever with me. Though, I cannot come to meet you before you depart. You are always in my heart dear. No one can take your place in my Heart. Thank you everything that you gave me happiness in my life. I will be loving you until I die.
