  I wish u r wid me..<br /> With ur hug under d shadow of tree..<br /> Making my day wid smile..<br /> Always wid u, no distance of mile..
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  One night u came as nightmare..<br /> Making me frightening, its nt fair..<br /> Searching u in d sky turning round n round..<br /> Wid ur absence, screaming wid my kneels down..
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  I still remember ur smile making me crazy..<br /> It’s u wid whom wanna to b busy..<br /> So many things to share..<br /> Wanna give u love n care..
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  How enjoyable u n me playing in rain..<br /> forgetting all sorrows n pain..<br /> Oh lord! Please hear my plea..<br /> It’s only wish, give my luv wid me..
